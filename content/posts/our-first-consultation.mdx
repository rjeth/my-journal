It was filled with joy as my Love and I had our first dermatology consultation. From a peaceful park visit (satisfy our rest cravings,) to exploring a museum and enjoying Chef Baboy's unli samgyupsal, every moment was delightful. Despite missing out on Shabu Nara's specialties, should be our first try, but the overall experience was worth cherishing. Our day ended at SM Clark.

Hoping for more adventures, and I pray our next one happens right here in Manila.
