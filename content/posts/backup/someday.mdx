{/* I know those wounds are still tender and can't be managed with just any bandage.\
Someday, we'll relish the freedom of learning from each other as you heal from the bruises of being mistreated.\
We deserve a version of ourselves that's free from the anxiety of emotional abuse and trust issues.\
\
Hahayaan lang muna kita, you need ng peace of mind, While I'm away, I'll assure you that you're the only one I'll love. I've already committed to the Lord that it's only you, no one else.\
\
Till we share a smile again.\
\
Love\
Jeth */}
