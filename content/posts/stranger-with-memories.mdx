{/*
While I was heading home from practice for the camp meeting, I bumped into a familiar face from my past. She was my mutual understanding (MU) during high school, and we caught up on how we've been. She's doing well, though she had aimed to become an architect, she's currently working as an autocad operator in a firm. As we parted ways, we exchanged goodbyes.Today's encounter reminded me of the unexpected meeting with someone from my past, reviving shared memories and bridging the gap between strangers with a history. Perhaps one day, we'll meet again, perhaps with our respective life partners.*/}
