A member of our family recently experienced a frightening health scare. Yesterday, Oreo had a seizure that left his face disfigured and unbalanced, resembling the effects of a stroke.

It all began with a sudden and unexpected seizure. Oreo's body shook uncontrollably, and it was a heart-wrenching sight for all of us. Seizures in pets can be caused by various factors, including underlying health conditions or environmental triggers. Oreo's seizure was a terrifying moment. We are now closely monitoring his health, hoping that it will never happen again.

Hi Oreo! Please stay strong! Samahan kita lagi.
